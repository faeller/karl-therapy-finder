Either directly at a practice - or if that doesn't work out, through the cost reimbursement process.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Initial consultation via the appointment service (116 117) - they'll get you an appointment within 4 weeks. You'll get the PTV-11 form there, important for later.\n\n2. Contact therapists - I'll help with that. We write emails and make calls together. We document every rejection.\n\n3. If you find someone: Great, done!\n\nIf not, we keep searching and go the reimbursement route. Optional: trial sessions via the appointment service. With enough rejections (long wait times count too) you prove system failure.\n\nInsurance will deny it first - no worries, file an appeal. Works almost every time. Then they'll pay for private practices too, which have openings way more often.\n\nSounds like a lot? Don't worry, I'll guide you through it!",
